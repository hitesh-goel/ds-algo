/*
 * This implementation is of Min Heap
 * A Min Heap is a Complete Binary Tree. A Min heap is typically represented as an array. The root element will be at Arr[0].
 * For any ith node, i.e., Arr[i]:
 * - Arr[(i -1) / 2] returns its parent node.
 * - Arr[(2 * i) + 1] returns its left child node.
 * - Arr[(2 * i) + 2] returns its right child node.
